## How to package, install and uninstall Pyrsia extension in the IDE

The Pyrsia extension is not available in the VS Code store yet, it's necessary to manually install the extension as described below.

### Package and Install (side-load extension)

- Install [Visual Studio Code Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension#vsce) with the following command.

    ```sh
    npm install -g @vscode/vsce
    ```

- In the extension repository folder package the extension as follows.

    ```sh
    vsce package
    ```

- If the packaging was successful the last line of the VSCE logs should contain the `vsix` file path, for example:

    ```sh
    DONE  Packaged: /home/joed/repositories/pyrsia-vscode-extension/pyrsia-integration-0.0.1.vsix (960 files, 2.2MB)
    ```

- Copy the `vsix` file path and install the extension as follows.

    ```sh
    code --install-extension <PYRSIA_VSIX_FILE_PATH>
    ```

### Uninstall (side-load)

- Find the extension in the list of the extensions (look for "pyrsia", for example `undefined_publisher.pyrsia-integration`).

    ```sh
    code --list-extensions
    ```

- Use the extension name from the list to uninstall the extension.

    ```sh
    code --uninstall-extension <PYRSIA_EXTENSION_NAME>
    ```
